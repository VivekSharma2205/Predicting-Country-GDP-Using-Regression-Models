# Predicting-Country-GDP-Using-Regression-Models
We analyze the accuracy of 2023 GDP predictions across countries, examining key economic indicators such as GDP per capita, government expenditure, and trade figures. By comparing predicted and actual values, the project seeks to understand prediction discrepancies and improve economic forecastingÂ models.
